# Weather Forecasting App
Hello friends! I've developed a weather app that provides weather information for any city in the world.


# Technologies Used

1) HTML: For structure
2) CSS: For design, looks, and responsiveness
3) JavaScript: For dynamic functionality
4) Rapid API: For fetching weather information
5) Bootstrap: For creating weather cards on the website

# How to Use
To use the app, simply enter the name of your city or country into the input field. Upon clicking the button, it will display the weather data for the entered city.

# What It Shows
1) Humidity
2) Wind speed (including wind direction in degrees)
3) Temperature (maximum and minimum)
4) Sun information

This web app is responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes. Enjoy exploring the weather details of your favorite places!
